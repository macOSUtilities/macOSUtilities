## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
We collect and develop interesting and useful utilities for macOS, and fork or create them here! </br>
Our main developer, @kingkwahli, creates our improvement and redesigns of poorly-designed or unkept utilities, such as EFI Control (inspired by Drop-EFI) and MacUSB Creator.

This readme will be fully filled out soon!

Get in touch with the lead developer at (kwahli@naazimapps.com)[mailto:kwahli@naazimapps.com] or personally at (kwahli11@icloud.com)[mailto:kwahli11@icloud.com].
